This was the completion of a game I started in freshman year of highschool. It's made entirely in python
using pygame and moderngl. During the course of development, I learned how to create inverse kinematic
limbs (for creature animations) using the FABRIK algorithm, draw pixel art, contribute to open source 
code repositoriesm, write fragment and compute shaders, and organize
large codebases with an object oriented structure.
