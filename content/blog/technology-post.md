Independent of productive output, I am very opinionated on technology

### At school

At UC Berkeley, I use a 2012 Thinkpad X230 laptop which despite being 14 years old
holds up nicely to everyday tasks and a little gaming on the side

I have overhauled and modded the laptop and it now features an IPS display, custom
EC firmware to allow for the older style keyboard (X220), 16 GB of ram, Intel AX210 
wifi card, two SSDs, and has Coreboot installed (custom bios). Despite being a small,
albeit heavy, 12 inch laptop, it is a joy to program on and feels super rugged.

To go with my old laptop, is this 2000 CRT Monitor.

Unlike your ultrawide curved monitor, this monitor curves the other way...
These old monitors weigh a ton and make all sorts of weird noises but the color
contrast and slight pixel blurring makes it the go-to for gaming and watching TV shows.


### Music

I'm a big fan of cassette technology and own a few portable cassette players made at 
the hieght of Japanese engineering in the 80s. While cassettes are known for their
shortcomings, I have a great time listening and collecting cassettes and have even
learned to repair cassette players.

Some of my repairs have gotten extremely involved. I was able to make some money from
buying and repairing sony walkmans.

### Gaming

I haven't played a ton of games since college started but there are many games that I
love new and old. On the CRT computer monitor, games like Half Life 2, Brawlhalla,
cuphead, and even BG3 look super good.

I've been big into Retro gaming for a long time. Arcade and Nintendo classics!
Here is the Sony Trinitron that I use when playing WII or NES

In tangent to acquiring the CRT Monitor, I also found and restored this Model M 
keyboard known for it's buckling spring key action. It is super loud!
