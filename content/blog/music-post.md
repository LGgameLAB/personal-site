# Music

Like many kids, I played an instrument throughout middle and high school. 
I chose the violin in 4th grade but eventually learned to play the piano 
and clarinet in high school. I would spend a lot of time playing the 
violin and keyboard over covid and thats when my love for classical Music
and my first attempts at composition began. 

At that time, I listened to a lot of 80s music as well as classical. Today
I listen to all sorts of music like jazz rock, metal and djent, 

# Composition

I'm not sure how I learned to compose although I did make deliberate 
efforts to acquire basic compositional knowledge through youtube and 
online articles. Advanced concepts like counterpoint or atonal writing 
go right over my head but I have a basic grasp of 4 part harmony, chord 
progressions, modes, diationic chords, jazz chords, and lots of other 
stuff.

The free software musescore was really my entry point into the classical
style of composition. Nowadays my compositions start at the piano, get
transferred to paper, and then if they are good enough I'll engrave them 
on musescore. You can check my music out at:
