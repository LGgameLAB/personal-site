## Are you using vim?

For today's example I will be using VIM. Hopefully you guys have gotten a chance to look at VIM
but maybe it is still confusing and that's okay. It took me 6 months to get decent at using vim and 
I am still learning. To quote Jaysa:

"If you're really dedicated to learning, try to learn a new command each day. Use that command whenever you get the chance until it feels natural.
The more commands that you know, the cooler you'll look to the guy behind you while you're taking notes in class."

If you are looking to improve your vim skills there is a [good article](https://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/)
on improving progressively. I do recommend installing vimtutor for the most interactive learning experience.

## What is the shell? 

A shell is software program that acts as an interface between a user and the operating system's core (kernel)
So shell scripting can be seen as code we write to interface with our computer. Here is an example

<img src="/images/bash-cover.png"  style="width:70%">

This example was written in Bash which is an sh-compatible command language. But what does that mean?

To make sure shell scripts work on a all UNIX operating systems, POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) 
sets a standard (IEEE Standard 1003.1) by which all operating systems must comply. This means the same command
written to your default linux shell `sh` will always work. Nowadays there are modern shells such as Bash and Zsh
which add their own features on top of `sh`. 



## What are shell scripts used for? 

Shell scripts are used everywhere! They are like the glue behind system administration responsible
for all different types of automation. 

Many times you will encounter shell commands embedded in configuration files to run certain tasks. However
when tasks get more complicated, having a strong background in shell scripts becomes very useful

Just the other day I installed a linux package called downgrade. It is actually a single shell (/bin/downgrade)

So far I've shown you complicated shell scripts but they can be super simple
* Change monitors
* Teleport around computer (edit files)
* Change backgrounds
* Christmas Tree

The terminal can be used to directly run shell commands
* `echo`
* `ls` (-a -l)
* `grep`

## Mad libs

Today I'm going to make a little mad libs shell script with you guys

First we'll make a file and in it we can write the following code

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a noun: " noun
printf "There once was a %s" "$noun"
```

The top of the file is the shebang and if we remember from earlier, this tells the computer which interpreter
we should use which is important if we are using `zsh` or `bash` since the computer might default to `sh`.

The first line reads user input and saves it to the "variable" noun. The `-p` flag 
allows us to write a prompt for the user. `printf` lets us write output to the user.
Pretty Neat!

Lets make the Mad Lib more interesting

```bash
read -p "Enter a noun: " noun
read -p "Enter a verb (past tense): " verb
read -p "Enter a location: " location 
printf "There once was a %s. The %s %s in the %s." "$noun" "$noun" "$verb" "$location"
```

Notice, we added more `%s` to include more inputs to our f string. Cool cool no we can write a story and have it output to the user.

Notes:
* It is important that `$noun` is in quotes 

### Randomizing Mad libs



### Randomizing Mad libs

We can use the `shuf` command to randomize lists of items. For example
`ls | shuf` randomizes the directory.

We can combine this with a long list of nouns to create a random mad lib

* [Nouns](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/trag1c/f74b2ab3589bc4ce5706f934616f6195/raw/5aa7de70fc83664017cb97dd02cbf6dc76b9e4a3/nouns.txt)
* [Verbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janester/mad_libs/refs/heads/master/List%20of%20Verbs.txt)
* [Adjectives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janester/mad_libs/refs/heads/master/List%20of%20Adjectives.txt)
* [Adverbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janester/mad_libs/refs/heads/master/List%20of%20Adverbs.txt)
```
curl --silent https://gist.githubusercontent.com/trag1c/f74b2ab3589bc4ce5706f934616f6195/raw/5aa7de70fc83664017cb97dd02cbf6dc76b9e4a3/nouns.txt | shuf -n 1
```

What is happening here? Three main things at play
* `curl`
    * curl gets the information from the web which in this case is a long list of nouns
    * `--silent` suppresses the output of grep so we just get the raw information. This is a flag on many commands
* pipe operator `|`
    * As we've seen above, the pipe sends the output of the first command into the second
    * What happens when you run `ls | grep "filename"`
* `shuf`
    * Shuffles the list provided
    * `-n 1` returns the first line of the list we just shuffled

Now our Mad libs runs by itself and generates some pretty silly prompts. Fire!


### Saving mad libs to file


We can prompt the user to save the mad lib to file.

```bash
read -p "Would you like to save the file? (y/n): " yesno

if [ "$yesno" = "y" ]; then
    echo "Saving to file"
    echo "$madlib" >> madlibs.txt
else
    echo "See ya!"
fi
```

What exactly is happening here? Again we are using a read statement to get the user's input. A then we initiate an if statement
to see if the user replies "y" or "n". 

If the user replies yes then we save the madlib to a file

The `>` operator outputs to a file, overwriting anything if present.
The `>>` operator appends to the end of a file.

You could also do this with a case statement
```bash
case "$yesno" in
  “yes”)
    echo "Saving to file";;
  “y”)
    echo "Saving";;
  *)
    echo "See ya"
esac
```

Notes
* It is important to maintain spaces in your if statement brackets

### Things to keep in mind

If else and case statements
The importants of quotes and spaces
Read Error messages carefully
