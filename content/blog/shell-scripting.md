# Shell Scripting

What is the shell? Taking from AI:

"A shell is software program that acts as an interface between a user and the operating system's core (kernel)"

So shell scripting can be seen as code we write to interface with our computer. Here is an example

## Are you using vim?

For today's example I will be using VIM. Hopefully you guys have gotten a chance to look at VIM
but maybe it is still confusing and that's okay. It took me 6 months to get decent at using vim and 
I am still learning. To quote Jaysa:

"If you're really dedicated to learning, try to learn a new command each day. Use that command whenever you get the chance until it feels natural.
The more commands that you know, the cooler you'll look to the guy behind you while you're taking notes in class."

## What are shell scripts used for? 

Shell scripts are used everywhere! They are super tools for automation and so much more

Just the other day I installed a linux package called downgrade. It is actually a single shell (/bin/downgrade)

So far I've shown you complicated shell scripts but they can be super simple
* Change monitors
* Teleport around computer (edit files)
* Change backgrounds
* Christmas Tree

The terminal can be used to directly run shell scripts
* echo
* ls
* pipe operator
